# KNOBS FOR TURNING SOURCE
Hi, this is the source for [Knobs For Turning](https://davemakes.itch.io/knobs-for-turning). It's free to use and alter and redistribute for noncommercial purposes with credit (more info in LICENSE.md).

The game was built in Game Maker Studio 2.3.5. The code isn't exactly elegant but it should be pretty straightforward to figure out if you poke around.
